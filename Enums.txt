Enums
* A data type that allows a programmer to define a variable and specify the valid values that could be stored in that variable.
* Can create a variable named “myColor” and it can only contain one of the primary colors , red, yellow , or blue and no other values.
* You first have to define the enum type and give it a name
* Initiated by the keyword enum.
* Then the name of the enumerated data type.
* The list of identifiers (enclosed in a set of curly braces) that define the permissible values that can be assigned to the type :
enum primaryColor {red, yellow, blue};
* Variables declared to be of this data type can be assigned the values red, yellow, and blue inside the program, and no other values.
* To declare a variable to be of type enum primaryColor.
* Use the keyword enum
* Followed by the enumerated type name
* Followed by the variable list. So the statement.
enum primaryColor , myColor, gregsColor; 
* Defines the two variable myColor and gregsColor to be of type primaryColor
* The only permissible values that can be assigned to these variables are the names red, yellow and blue. 
* myColor = red;
* Another example
enum month {January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December};
* The compiler actually enumeration identifiers as integer constants
* First name in list in 0
enum month thisMonth;
…
thisMonth = February;


* The Value 1 is assigned to thisMonth ( and not the name February) because it is the second identifier listed inside the enumeration list.
* If  you want to have a specific integer value associated with an enumeration identifier, the integer  can be assigned to the identifier when the data type is defined.
enum direction{up, down, left =10, right};


* An enumerated data type direction is defined with the values up, down, left, and right.
* up= 0, because it appear first in the list
* 1 to down because it appears next
* 10  to left because it is explicitly assigned the value .
* 11 to right because it appears immediately after left in the list.
