Basic Data Types
* We understand the C supports many different types of variables and types of variable is used for storing different kinds of data :
* Types that store integers
* Types that store non-integral numerical values
* Types that store characters
* Some examples of basic data types in C are:
int 
float
double
char
_Bool


* The difference between the types is in the amount of memory they occupy and the range of the values they can hold:
* The amount of storage that is allocated to store a particular type of data 
* Depends on the computer you are running (machine- dependent)
* An integer might take up 32bits on your computer , or perhaps it might be stored in 64.
int
* A variable of type int can be used to contain integral values only ( values that do not contain decimal places)
* A minus sign preceding the data type and variable indicates that the value is negative.
* The int type is a signed integer.
* It must be an integer and it can be positive, negative, or Zero.
* If an integer is preceded by a zero and the letter x (either lowercase it uppercase), the value is taken as being expressed in hexadecimal (based 16) notation.
* int rbgColor = 0xFFEF0D;
* The values  158, -10, and 0 are all valid examples of integer constants
* No embedded space are permitted between the digits
* Values larger than 999 cannot be expressed using commas (12,000 must be written as 12000)
float
* A variable to be of type float can be used for storing floating-point numbers (values containing decimal places)
* The values 3., 125.8, -.0001 are all valid examples of floating-point constants that can be assigned to a variable .
* Floating-point constants can also be expressed in scientific notation.
* 1.7e4 is a floating-point value expressed in this notation and represents the value 1.7 x 10 to the power of 4.


double 
* The double type is the same as type float, only with roughly twice the precision.
* Used whenever the range provided by a float variable is not sufficient.
* Can store twice as many significant digits
* Most computers represent double values using 64bits.
* All floating-point constants are taken as double values by the C compiler 
* To explicitly express a float constant, append either an f or F to the end of the number.
* 12.5f
_Bool
* The _Bool data type can be used to store just the values 0 or 1
* Used for indicating an on/off , yes/no, or true/false situation (binary choices)
* _Bool variables are used in programs that need to indicate a Boolean condition.
* A variable of this type might be used to indicate whether all data has been read from a file
* 0 is used to indicate a false value 
* 1 indicate a true value
